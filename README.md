# Breast-cancer-detection

Dataset Information:
Shape: 569 rows, 32 columns
Target Variable (diagnosis):
B: Benign (357 instances)
M: Malignant (212 instances)
Features: Various measurements related to breast cancer characteristics.
Data Analysis:
Converted diagnosis from categorical to numerical using LabelEncoder.
Correlation analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient to understand feature relationships.
Next Steps:
To build a breast cancer detection model, you can proceed with the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Scale the features if necessary (especially for models sensitive to feature scales).
Model Building:

Choose a suitable classifier (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines).
Train the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.
Fine-tune the model parameters if needed (e.g., through cross-validation).
Visualization:

Visualize important features, model performance metrics (e.g., ROC curve), and any insights from the dataset.
Here's a simple example using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification:

```python
# Example code for KNN classification
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset (replace df with your actual DataFrame)
# df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Separate features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df.drop(columns=['diagnosis'])
y = df['diagnosis']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Train the model
knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Confusion matrix
conf_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print('Confusion Matrix:')
print(conf_mat)
